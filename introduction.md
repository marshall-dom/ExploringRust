# Introduction

## Who am I?

My name is Dominic Marshall, a graduate student studying computer science at DePaul University.
My primary interests lie in distributed systems and big data--particularly in the application
of distributed computing to solve issues that burden our world. Outside of computer science,
I am a musician and former NCAA D1 Track and Field athlete who has an unhealthy obsession with
coffee.
