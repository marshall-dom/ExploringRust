# Getting Started

### Disclaimer

I may have jumped the gun a bit on this module. I already downloaded and configured
Rust on my machine, as well as read through the entirety of this module; however,
I will be rereading the information regarding Cargo as I believe it is important
to understand the underpinnings of this tooling.

With that out of the way, lets continue...

## My Thoughts

After having used languages without tightly integrated build systems and package managers
(I'm looking at you Java...), the idea of a language that has a standardized and well-supported
system for managing dependencies and builds is extremely attractive. Moreover, everything I have
seen thus far leads me to believe Cargo is well-built and actively maintained. Lastly, the
inclusion of a standardized formatting tool in the build system is a big win in my opinion.
